In this analysis, we observe that the Capomulin and Ramicane regimens yielded the smallest average tumor sizes among the treatment regimens. Additionally, these regimens exhibited lower variance, standard deviation, and standard error compared to the others, indicating that the data within these groups is more tightly clustered. This suggests that the variance is likely a result of the properties and effectiveness of these drugs, rather than being influenced by outliers.
Notably, these two drugs also had the largest number of mice tested among the regimens, making their tight data groups even more impressive.
The distribution of mice across sexes was fairly balanced, with approximately equal numbers of males and females. Therefore, it's unlikely that the overall dataset is skewed due to an under or over-representation of one sex in the testing.
Among the promising drugs, including Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, Capomulin and Ramicane stood out as the most impressive. Their box plots further illustrated their superiority, showcasing lower average tumor sizes and a lack of outliers that could distort the results.
Moreover, there exists a strong correlation between the average tumor size and the weight of mice in the Capomulin regimen. This suggests that incorporating weight loss, diet, and exercise alongside the treatment may lead to more favorable outcomes. However, further testing is recommended to validate this hypothesis.
